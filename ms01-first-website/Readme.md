### MileStone 1 : Your first WebSite 

#### What are Milestones?
- Milestones are products you build to enhance and cement
software craftsmanship skills
- Treat milestones as if they are actual products you're building to deliver to a client 
- Get creative with your skills
- Most milestones won't have defined structure or instructions. The idea is to explore as much as possible while building a product
- Ideally you should be working with things you haven't explored in the topics you already know. Push the envelope as much as possible  
- Remember you will be re-working on these milestones to include them in your portfolio. Keep the code clean and professional. No [spaghetti code](https://jaxenter.com/the-dangers-of-spaghetti-code-117807.html)



#### MileStone 1 : Your First WebSite

We're going to create your first website. This will be a simple HTML/CSS site that you will create on a topic you are passionate about. 

Discuss with your partner a topic that both of you care deeply about. You will be making a website on this topic. 

Think of the following things before you start building:

- Learn about the [flow of designing a website](https://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes/)
- What does the structure of the site look like? What's the [sitemap](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/156184?hl=en)? Will you need [wireframes](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-wireframing--webdesign-7399)?
- How many pages will ti have? How do you want the pages to look? Do you want all pages to look the same? 
- Will it have a color scheme? Can you define this in your CSS file?
-- Think of elements that repeat themselves across the site like Headings, Text, Links, Images etc.
- What does the [navigation](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/common-website-navigation-mistakes/) of the site look like?
- How does the website look on [mobile](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/emulate-mobile-viewports)?
